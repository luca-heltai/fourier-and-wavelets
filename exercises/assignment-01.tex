\begin{exercise} 
    Reciprocal basis

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prove that the vectors
        \[
            b_1 = 
          \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\ 2
          \end{pmatrix} 
          \qquad
            b_2 =
            \begin{pmatrix}
                -1 \\ 1
            \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        form a non-orthogonal basis for $\R^2$, with respect to the standard
        inner product.
        \item Find the corresponding dual basis $\{\tilde{b}^1, \tilde{b}^2\}$ for $\R^2$.
        \item Find the metric matrix $g$, and use it to find the reciprocal basis $\{b^1,b^2\}$ for $\R^2$.
        \item Sketch the bases $\{b_1,b_2\}$ and $\{b^1,b^2\}$  in the $xy$ plane, and verify the bi-orthogonality relations.
        \item Express an arbitrary vector $u\in \R^2$ as a linear combination of
        $\{b_1,b_2\}$ and also of $\{b^1,b^2\}$.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
    Star notation in Hilbert space, Rietz representation theorem.

    Let 
        \[
            h(t) = \begin{cases}
                e^{-2t} & t \geq 1 \\
                0 & t < 1.
            \end{cases}
        \]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Show that $h(t) \in L^2(\R)$, and compute $\|h\|$.
        \item Find the linear functional $\tilde h \in V^* \equiv L^2(\R)$
        corresponding to $h$. That is, give the expression for $\tilde h(f)$ for
        any $f  \in L^2(\R)$.
        \item Let $g(t) = e^{-3t}$. Find the operator $F := g \tilde{h} :
        L^2(\R) \to L^2(\R)$. That is, give the expression for $F(f)$ for any $f
        \in L^2(\R)$.
        \item Find the operator $G := h \circ \tilde{g} : L^2(\R) \to L^2(\R)$.
        How is $G$ related to $F$?
        \item Compute $\tilde{h} f $ and $F(f)$ \emph{explicitly} for $f(t) = t e^{-t^2}$.
    \end{itemize}
