# AMCS 237: Fourier and Wavelet Theory

## Overview
The course provides a detailed and mathematically precise introduction to
Fourier, Wavelet and multiresolution analysis from a computational point of
view. This includes algorithmical aspects, complexity analysis, and exemplary
applications relevant to scientific and visual computing.

## Goals and Objectives
The course is algorithmically oriented aiming to enable the students to develop
principled computational methods for problems related to Fourier, Wavelet and
multiresolution analysis.

 
## Required Knowledge 
The course will assume solid knowledge (calculus and linear algebra) such as
taught in undergraduate mathematics courses or in AMCS 101, 131, and 151.

## Assignments and Evaluation
There will be a problem set assigned each week to prepare for the final exam.
This homework track is mostly theoretical, but it will include smaller
programming tasks along the way. The students may collaborate on the
assignments. Grading policy: 100% final exam.
